## Getting Started

### Accessing the Source Code

```bash
git clone
```

### Prerequisites

- Python v3.6.8
- Poetry

### Project Structure

Describe structure of project in terms of generic folders and poetry (and other python tools) usage

### Backend

```bash
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data '{"job_name": "job_id_name", "input_bucket_name": "input_bucket_name", "input_s3_path": "s3_object_name", "output_bucket_name": "output_bucket_name"}' -s -w  "%{time_starttransfer}\n" http://0.0.0.0:5000/redaction
```

## System Design
<!-- ## Testing

### The Importance Of Automation
SnapBee Figure Extraction is maintained by a small team of talented software engineers studying at Cornell under Cornell Data Science as a side project. The team wants to deliver new features faster without sacrificing its quality. Testing ever-increasing amount of features manually soon becomes impossible â€” unless we want to spend all our time with manual, repetitive work instead of delivering working features.

Test automation is the only way forward.

### Testing Strategy

![Test Strategy](docs/testing/test-strategy.png)

Please read [Testing Strategies in a Microservice Architecture](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-testing)
for a detailed introduction on test strategies.

### Unit Testing

A unit test exercises the smallest piece of testable software in the
application to determine whether it behaves as expected.

![Unit Test](docs/testing/unit-test.png)

Run unit tests for backend:

```bash
python -m pytest ...
```

#### Sociable And Solitary

![Two Types of Unit Test](docs/testing/unit-test-two-types.png)

#### The FIRST Principal

- [F]ast: Unit tests should be fast otherwise they will slow down
   development & deployment.
- [I]ndependent: Never ever write tests which depend on other test cases.
- [R]epeatable: A repeatable test is one that produces the same results
   each time you run it.
- [S]elf-validating: There must be no manual interpretation of the results.
- [T]imely/[T]horoughly: Unit tests must be included for every pull request
   of a new feature and cover edge cases, errors, and bad inputs.

#### Test Structure

A automated test method should be composed of 3As: Arrange, Act, and Assert.

- [A]rrange: All the data needed for a test should be arranged as part
  of the test. The data used in a test should not depend on the environment
  in which the test is running.
- [A]ct: Invoke the actual method under test.
- [A]ssert: A test method should test for a single logical outcome. -->
